/*
 * You are given an array called paths, where each paths[i] = [cityA, cityB] represents a direct path going from cityA to cityB.

Your task is to:

Print the entire path from the starting city (source) to the destination city, eliminating any cycles inside the graph.

âœ… Notes:
The graph will always have exactly one source city and exactly one destination city.

A source city is a city that only appears as a starting point but never as a destination.

A destination city is a city that only appears as a destination but never as a starting point.

There may be cycles in the input, but the valid path is cycle-free from source to destination.

ðŸ“¥ Input:
An array paths where each element is a pair of strings [cityA, cityB] indicating a direct route from cityA to cityB.

ðŸ“¤ Output:
A string representing the full path from source city to destination city in the following format:
